- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jay-Melichar
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking, fitness, and adventure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JS (I'm a newbie so the process has been interesting)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on.. Nothing at the moment just because I'm still learning a lot but I'm always down for tips and tricks or any general advice!
- 📫 How to reach me.. Who knows
